# Vakio palette

Vakio is a light-background syntax color palette that:

* is parametrized in the 
[Oklch color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space) 
using two lightness levels at which chroma is maximized, 
see [Palette design](design.ipynb)

* can be injected into 
[Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) templates, 
see [Usage](usage.ipynb)

* provides higher contrast between text and background than many popular light-background themes, see [Comparison](comparison.ipynb)
