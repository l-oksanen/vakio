# Vakio palette

Vakio is a light-background syntax color palette that

* is parametrized in the 
[Oklch color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space) 
by two lightness levels at which chroma is maximized, 
see [info.ipynb](info.ipynb)

* can be injected into 
[Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) templates, 
see [usage.ipynb](usage.ipynb)
